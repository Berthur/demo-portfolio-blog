                <h1>Interactive Fractal</h1>

                <p>For this demo, we want to make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" target="_blank">fractal</a> rendering that is navigable in real-time, with intuitive panning and zooming as if it were a large digital image. Fractal renderings that keep zooming into a predefined point are common, and offline rendering allows for fancier visual effects and much deeper zooming. However, letting the user explore it freely, in real-time, provides a different educational experience into fractals and the visual beauty of mathematics. It is also an excellent exercise in shader programming.</p>

                <h2>The Mandelbrot Fractal</h2>

                <p>One of the most famous fractals is the boundary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set" target="_blank">Mandelbrot set</a>, which is defined by a surprisingly simple function:</p>

                <p class="eq"><span-latex>
                    f_c(z) = z^2 + c
                </span-latex></p>

                <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number" target="_blank">complex number</a> <span-latex>c \in \C</span-latex> belongs to the Mandelbrot set if and only if the function above, repeatedly applied starting from zero, does not diverge. In other words: <span-latex>f_c(f_c( \dots f_c(0) \dots ))</span-latex>, applied infinitely.</p>

                <p>Conveniently, the complex plane is two-dimensional, just like a computer screen. So if we plot the complex plane onto the screen, such that each pixel is given one colour if its complex coordinate belongs to the Mandelbrot set and another colour if it doesn't, we will get the simplest visualisation of the fractal curve. Doing this will already reveal the famous shape:</p>

                <img width="500px" src="../resources/blog/fractal_binary_10000_1xAA.png" alt="Mandelbrot Set">
                <p class="imgText"><em>Fig. 1:</em> The mandelbrot set in its simplest visualization: Computing whether the complex number corresponding to the coordinate of each pixel centre belongs to the set or not. Turquoise pixels belong to the set.</p>

                <p>However, there is more to the Mandelbrot fractal than the boundary. A common visualization algorithm takes into account also the speed of divergence of each point, and visualizes it in different colours. In other words, how many times the mapping function has to be applied on a point before exiting a certain radius. Such colouring reveals some depth in the fractal:</p>

                <img width="500px" src="../resources/blog/fractal_zoomed_tentacle.jpg" alt="Colouring based on rate of divergence">
                <p class="imgText"><em>Fig. 2:</em> Colouring based on rate of divergence. This picture is of a smaller part of the fractal, after zooming in a little.</p>

                <p>But the real marvel of fractals is the zoom: By mapping the screen to a smaller portion of the complex plane, we achieve a zooming effect that reveals new patterns of the fractal. Mathematically, one can continue zooming indefinitely, and there are renderings that reach extreme depths and continue to reveal new and fantastic shapes and patterns. However, the deeper the zoom, the more computationally expensive it becomes to render the fractal, both because higher precision is needed in the number representations used, and because more iterations of the mapping function are needed as points diverge slower.</p>
